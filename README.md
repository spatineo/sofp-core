# sofp-core

This is a proof of concept server to test using the WFS 3.0 specification for distributing meteorological data using an encoding that will be calle simple observation features. The core project only serves as a proxy to a backend implementation that provides access to data. Deployment strategy is dockerized so that the sofp-core will produce a docker image that a backend implementation may build on top of.

  docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8080:3000/tcp sofp/core

## CI

This project is using Semaphore CI: https://semaphoreci.com/sampov2/sofp-core-2

## OGC API Features Validation

API Features validation can be checked using the OGC Team Engine

1. When you have SOFP running, start the team engine test suite in docker: `docker run --network=host ogccite/ets-ogcapi-features10`
2. Access the team engine via a browser http://localhost:8081/teamengine/
3. Log in to teamengine (login `ogctest`/`ogctest`)
4. Create new test session, select: organisation = OGC, specification = OGC API - Features 1.0, click "start new test session"
5. Enter location of landing page (for example http://localhost:3000/sofp)
6. Click "start"
